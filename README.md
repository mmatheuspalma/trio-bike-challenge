#### Libraries Added
- date-fns ( manipulate dates )
- vue-date-picker ( base for the booking calendar )

#### Notes

My intention was to add some tests for the application, but unfortunatelly I didn't had time enought due some personal issues.

I would like to have the opportunity to write the Unit, E2e and API tests if possible.

The tests that I was going to do if I have the chance:
- E2e Bike Rent
- E2e Bike Amount/Pricing
- E2e bike Rent Errors
- Unit Bike Calendar Component
- Unit Bike Rent Success Component
- Unit Bike Rent Alert Error Component
- API Rent Amount/Pricing
- Backend Mocked Tests for the new Methods ( List Available, Rents By Bike, Rent, Rent Amount )
